# The-analytical-solution-to-the-APES
This project shows the source code in the article "Comments on ‘Primary-Ambient Extraction Using Ambient Spectrum Estimation for Immersive Spatial Audio Reproduction’".

The article provides an analytic solution to the APES. APES is proposed by Jianjun He, et al. and He provided the experimental audio and source code in https://jhe007.wixsite.com/main#!ambient-spectrum-estima-tion/c6bk. Therefore, only the code of AS is provided in this project.

If you want to use our code, please cite our paper.
